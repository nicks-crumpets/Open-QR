# Open-QR
Open source tool for creating QR codes with logos, colour styles and various styles!

Why make this?
Because I haven't found a QR code maker that's everything it should be, given how relitively simple they are to make, especially seeing all of the apps and websites that are charging for the simple QR code making.
I do know that versions of this do exist, but I wanted to make one muyself that's both open source, and user friendly.

# Roadmap

- [x] ~~Create the first working 'prototype'~~
- [ ] Allow for complete user selection on as many options as possible, colours, custom logos etc.
- [ ] Use a GUI framework to create a desktop app (Maybe tkinter?)
- [ ] Make a web version
- [ ] Get funding to host the website
More coming soon...
